Not sure exactly how to use a Github imported notebook so, you may just use the above notebook link.
To execute, simply select Runtime -> Run all in top toolbar.

2/2/2022
Updated notebook now saved as Poke2Dog master
Training was done in google cloud environment which does not support google drive(???)
Therefore, code now requires traning data to be uploaded to colab runtime.
Execution instruction remain the same as original notebook.
